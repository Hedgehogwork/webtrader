## Lookbacks

### What are lookbacks
A lookback contract has a payout that depends on the optimum high or low achieved by the market. The option allows the holder to "look back" over time to determine the payout.

### Types of lookbacks
We offer three types lookbacks:

- Win the multiplier times the high minus close.

- Win the multiplier times the close minus low.
![Close-Low](https://www.binary.com/images/pages/trade-explanation/en/close-low.svg)

- Win the multiplier times the high minus low.

For example, let’s say the market has a low of 5,200 and a close of 6,000 over the contract duration, then a ‘Close-Low’ lookback with a multiplier of $2 would have a payout of:
    
`(6,000 – 5,200) * 2 = $1600`

Lookbacks are currently only available for Volatility Indices.
